# DillyzThe1's Role API
This adds a new API for simplistic roles in among us.
Permission for use is granted, as long as you credit me.

# Documentation
Documatation for this API is being worked on.

# Discord
https://discord.gg/Xfk4FUep - Get sneak peeks at new mods or updates and chat around!
https://discord.gg/2GTBQPMEVb - My main server full of chaos, designed for my YouTube channel.

# Original Idea
- This API was made for mods that will be made along-side Luke Wainy, but all mods on my github page are made alone.

# Common Errors
-- No documented errors as of yet --

# Sourced code
https://github.com/NotHunter101/ExtraRolesAmongUs
https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod/blob/master/src/CrowdedMod/Patches/GenericPatches.cs
The rest of API was written out of my knowledge of unity and past experiences.

# Note
You will need Reactor for this. This is provided in the download.
The original file of Reactor: https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor/actions
If you have any problems with this api or me as a creator, feel free to ping me in my server or the reactor server. (DM's are off)
