# DillyzThe1's Role API
This adds a new API for simplistic roles in among us.
Permission for use is granted, as long as you credit me.

# Documentation
https://github.com/DillyzThe1/DillyzRoleApi/blob/main/instructions/guide.md

# Discord
https://discord.gg/49NFTwcYgZ - Get sneak peeks at new mods or updates and chat around!
https://discord.gg/2GTBQPMEVb - My main server full of chaos, designed for my YouTube channel.

# Original Idea
- This API was made for mods that will be made along-side Luke Wainy, but all mods on my github page are made alone.

# Common Errors
-- No documented errors as of yet --

The rest of API was written out of my knowledge of unity and past experiences.

# Note
You will need Reactor for this. This is provided in the download, but can also be excluded.
